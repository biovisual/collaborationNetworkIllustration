	Abstract = {<title>Author Summary</title><p>White matter tracts crisscrossing the human cortex are linked in a complex pattern that constrains human thought and behavior. Why the human brain displays the complex pattern that it does is a fascinating open question. Progress in uncovering generative mechanisms for this architecture requires greater knowledge about mechanistic drivers of anatomical networks. Here we contrast network properties derived from images of the human brain with 13 synthetic network models investigated in a progressive, branching sequence, chosen to probe the roles of physical embedding and temporal growth. We characterize both the empirical and synthetic networks using network diagnostics presented here in statistical form, as scatter plots and distributions, to reveal the full range of variability of each measure. We find that synthetic models that constrain the network nodes to be physically embedded in anatomical brain regions tend to produce distributions that are most similar to the corresponding measurements for the brain. We also find that network models hardcoded to display one network property do not in general simultaneously display a second, suggesting that multiple neurobiological mechanisms drive human brain network development. The network models that we develop and employ enable statistical inference of brain network structure from neuroimaging data.</p>},
